3. Standardize coding practices across development teams

**Stakeholders**:
1. Development Teams (primary users)
2. Project Managers (tracking code quality metrics)

**Key Performance Indicator (KPI)**:
- Reduction in post-deployment bugs (measured by comparing bug reports before and after system implementation)

### 2. Data Collection & Preprocessing (8 points)

**Data Sources**:
1. Open-source code repositories (GitHub, GitLab) with associated code review comments
2. Internal code review history and bug tracking systems

**Potential Bias**:
- Over-representation of certain programming languages (e.g., JavaScript, Python) in training data could lead to reduced performance on less common languages

**Preprocessing Steps**:
1. Code tokenization and normalization (removing comments, standardizing whitespace)
2. Feature extraction (AST generation, complexity metrics)
3. Balancing dataset across programming languages and project types

### 3. Model Development (8 points)

**Model Choice**: Transformer-based architecture (specifically CodeBERT)

**Justification**:
- Pre-trained on large code corpus
- Handles variable-length input effectively
- Strong performance in code understanding tasks
- Built-in attention mechanism for context awareness

**Data Splitting**:
- Training set: 70% (chronologically older code reviews)
- Validation set: 15% (more recent code reviews)
- Test set: 15% (most recent code reviews)
- This temporal split helps detect concept drift

**Hyperparameters to Tune**:
1. Learning rate: Critical for model convergence and avoiding local minima
2. Attention dropout rate: Important for preventing overfitting on specific code patterns

### 4. Evaluation & Deployment (8 points)

**Evaluation Metrics**:
1. Precision: Important because false positives (incorrect suggestions) waste developer time
2. Recall: Critical for not missing serious code issues

**Concept Drift**:
- Definition: Changes in the relationship between input features and target variables over time
- Monitoring: Track model performance metrics weekly, comparing against baseline
- Implementation: Use sliding window evaluation on recent code reviews

**Technical Challenge**:
- Scalability: Processing large codebases in real-time
- Solution: Implement distributed processing and caching mechanisms

## Part 2: Case Study Application (40 points)

   - Generate comorbidity scores
4. Normalization
   - Scale numerical features
   - Encode categorical variables
5. Validation
   - Data quality checks
   - Cross-reference with medical knowledge

### Model Development (10 points)

**Model Selection**: Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (XGBoost)

**Justification**:
- Handles mixed data types well
- Interpretable predictions
- Good performance with imbalanced data
- Built-in feature importance
- Efficient training and inference

**Confusion Matrix (Hypothetical)**:
```
                 Predicted No    Predicted Yes
Actual No         800 (TN)       100 (FP)
Actual Yes        150 (FN)       450 (TP)
```

**Metrics**:
- Precision = 450/(450+100) = 0.82

## Part 3: Critical Thinking (20 points)

### Ethics & Bias (10 points)

**Impact of Biased Training Data**:
- Underrepresentation of minority groups could lead to less accurate predictions
- Socioeconomic factors might not be properly accounted for
- Historical healthcare access disparities could be perpetuated

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Implement fairness constraints in model training

- Collect additional data from underrepresented populations
- Collaborate with domain experts to validate model decisions

### Trade-offs (10 points)

**Interpretability vs. Accuracy**:
- Healthcare requires explainable decisions
- Complex models might achieve higher accuracy but be less interpretable
- Solution: Use interpretable models (e.g., GBDT) with SHAP values
- Maintain balance between performance and explainability

**Resource Constraints**:
- Impact on model choice:
  - Prefer lighter models (e.g., Random Forest over Deep Learning)
  - Implement batch processing
  - Use feature selection to reduce dimensionality
  - Consider cloud computing for training only
