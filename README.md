## Stages of Development

1. **Problem Definition**
   - Clear problem statement
   - Success criteria
   - Stakeholder analysis

2. **Data Collection & Processing**
   - Data sources
   - Preprocessing pipeline
   - Data quality measures

3. **Model Development**
   - Model architecture
   - Training process
   - Evaluation metrics

4. **Implementation**
   - System integration
   - API development
   - Testing strategy

5. **Deployment**
   - Deployment strategy
   - Monitoring setup
   - Maintenance plan

6. **Ethical Considerations**
   - Bias analysis
   - Privacy measures
   - Environmental impact
